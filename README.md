# SenTube â€” Youtube sentiment analysis model (case study)

Paper Title: A Sentiment Analysis Case Study to Understand How A YouTuber Can Derive Decision Insights From Comments
This was our SET (Science Engineering and Technology) Project for the seventh semester of our Integrated MSc. programme on Computational Statistics and Data Analytics in VIT, Vellore. For this we are basically supposed to make a project under a faculty guide in the format of a Research Project and present it to a body of external faculties in the 'SET conference' conducted every year in VIT. For this project, I along with Pavitra worked on a Sentiment Analysis Case Study on two Youtube Comments dataset guided by Dr. SRV Prasad Bhuvanagiri Sir. The name of the project was given: "A Sentiment Analysis Case Study to Understand How A YouTuber Can Derive Decision Insights From Comments". You could find the Research Paper as a pdf document in the repository.
